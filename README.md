Grammar Mistakes
Credit: mactrunk/Getty Images

Do misspelled words drive you into a red pen-wielding furry? Do you appreciate a well-placed semi-colon? You might be an English teacher. If not an English teacher, then you're definitely a lapsed English major. If you rejoice at correct grammar—including the proper uses of "affect" and "effect" and how to make your last name plural—you might also be part of that ever-proofreading group. Whether you're an English teacher, an English teacher-at-heart (there are plenty of us out there too), or someone who likes to point out typos wherever they may be, we have a challenge for you.

If grammatical mistakes make you cringe, take a look at the letter below, and test your knowledge of the English language. There are 13 grammatical mistakes to find (that we know of), and we're betting that you'll be 13 for 13.
The Letter

Dear Jane,

I was delighted to read your letter last week. It's always a pleasure to recieve the latest news and to hear that you and your family had a great summer.

We spent last week at the beach and had so much fun on the sand and in the water exploring the coast we weren't prepared for the rains that came at the end of the vacation. The best parts of the trip was the opportunities to sightsee and relax.

My kids are back in school to. I find their are less things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There is plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August, I've running out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand-new activities next summer; hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.

Thanks again for your letter!

Sincerely,
Karen# Para
